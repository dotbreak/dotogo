# why

Though there are many todo apps on the market, it is hard to find one which has both the simplicity and the extensibility needed to get the work done. Something a simple as a calendar view of the upcoming tasks is often a paid feature on most commercial todo apps. Conversely, no one wants to spend more time on a todo app than on the actual work to be done, every action (task creation, task update) must be super fast.

# terminology

**dotogo** is straightforward and does not try to reinvent the wheel. However if you are used to another todo software, some extra explanation might help.

- project <==> board (Trello) <==> list (Reminders) : contains a set of tasks.
- task <==> card (Trello) : something that needs to be done.
